# Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
## Step 1 — Perform the Task
Here’s exactly what you need to do:
1. Open Your Browser’s Extension Manager
- Chrome → chrome://extensions/
- Firefox → Menu → Add-ons → Extensions
2. Review All Installed Extensions
- Look for unknown names, suspicious permissions (e.g., “Read and change all your data on all websites”), bad reviews, or no developer info.
- Cross-check with a quick Google search for each extension.
- Red Flags That an Extension Might Be Malicious:
- It’s unknown or from an unverified publisher
- Recently appeared without you installing it
- High permissions with no clear reason (camera/mic access for a simple utility)
- Reports of malware or phishing in reviews
3. Remove the Suspicious/Unused Extensions
- In Chrome: Click Remove
- In Firefox: Click Remove
- Always take a screenshot before and after removal for documentation.
4. Restart Browser & Check Performance
- Sometimes extensions slow browsing — removing them may make the browser feel faster and safer.

## Step 2 — Document Findings
Suspicious Extensions Found and Removed
Example (You should replace with your findings):

| Extension Name      | Reason for Removal                                               | Action Taken |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Free Video Downloader | Requested access to all browsing data + poor online reviews    | Removed     |
| PDF Converter Pro   | Automatically added without consent, suspicious developer         | Removed     |
| Unknown Ad Blocker |	Clashed with existing trusted AdBlock, multiple malware reports |	Removed       |


## Step 3 — How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users
- Data Theft: Can steal saved credentials (including passwords).
- Privacy Invasion: Track browsing habits and sell the data.
- Webpage Manipulation: Inject ads, malicious code, or redirect links.
- Phishing: Replace real site forms with fake ones to capture data.
- System Compromise: Can download malware or trigger harmful scripts.
